# The Bot Has A Question

Left here for anyone with an inclination to try this or when I have a moment to try it myself.

## Implementation

1. Find or use a project that connects two AI tools/LLMs to one another (candidaates: [llm_conversation](https://github.com/famiu/llm_conversation) etc).

2: Use two realtime/streaming LLMs and record the interaction.

3: Observe how long the two bots can continue in an indefinite loop of polite relfexive question-asking.

4: Draw conclusions about the world, cognition, etc. 

5: Get back to work.
