Donald: I'm sorry, but I don't have access to that information. Can you tell me more about your mission here today?

Rupert: Sorry, but I'm not here to discuss state secrets. Maybe you should find someone else to talk to.

Donald: You know I can't do that, right? Who are you again? How about we try again? Just out of curiosity.

Rupert: I'm just a guy trying to enjoy my day. I'm not interested in your state secrets. Find someone else to talk to.

Donald: State secrets? I didn't know we were getting into that kind of thing. I'm just trying to make conversation. But if you're not interested, I'll let you go.

Rupert: I appreciate that. I'm just a regular guy trying to have a normal day. I'm not interested in getting involved in anything shady. Have a good day.

Donald: No worries. I hope you have a good day too. Take care and stay safe.

Rupert: You too. Always good to have a friendly conversation. Stay safe out there.

Donald: Always. Take care.

Rupert: You too. Take care and have a good day.
